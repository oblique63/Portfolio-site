        <h1>Enrique Gavidia</h1>
        This is an homage to the native San Franciscan musician / designer / writer / programmer / philosopher / seat warmer extraordinaire.
        Despite living a life shrouded in relative obscurity, the man has accomplished several amazing feats of mediocrity in order
        to earn himself this mild apprasal; including the writing of many shamelessly lengthy, self-serving passages in third-person.  Driven by his rage
        to master, Enrique has always gone against all odds in performing his numerous death-defying acts, such as living off of a pseudo-IT 
        job on minimum wage, and being an early Windows Vista adopter. But despite his epic bravery, irrisistible charm, and inconceivable 
        prowess across a vast spectrum of insignificant fields, it is important to remember that he is still a mere mortal like anyone else; and 
        as such, needs a decent income to survive *hint**hint*. If nothing else is ascertained, let this much be known: Enrique is the hottest thing 
        to grace his neighborhood since spicy Mexican tamarind candy...
        <br /><br /> 
        Here lies a fragmented documentation of his underrated glory.
